### Architectural Components:

- **DNS Monitoring Lambda Functions**: Deployed across multiple AWS regions, these serverless functions execute continuous DNS health checks on critical service endpoints, providing real-time data on resolution performance and availability.
- **Multi-Region Failover Manager**: A centralized orchestration component that manages the automated failover process. It continuously assesses regional health and, when necessary, executes traffic rerouting, DNS updates, and resource scaling in the designated failover region.
- **Real-Time Web Dashboard**: A Flask-based web application that visualizes the collected monitoring data, offering a user-friendly and intuitive interface for observing system health and performance metrics in real time.
- **CloudWatch Dashboards and Alarms**: The system creates custom Amazon CloudWatch dashboards and alarms, providing seamless integration for monitoring and alerting within the native AWS management console.
- **EventBridge Rules**: Utilizes Amazon EventBridge to schedule and trigger the DNS monitoring and failover-check Lambda functions at regular, configurable intervals, ensuring continuous oversight.
- **IAM Roles and Policies**: Implements a robust security posture through meticulously configured IAM roles and policies, adhering to the principle of least privilege while granting the necessary permissions for the system to operate.

## System Components

### Core Logic

- **`outage_prevention_system.py`**: This is the central component of the proactive monitoring system. It is responsible for executing DNS health checks, leveraging a machine learning model to analyze data for anomalies, assessing the risk of cascading failures, and initiating automated responses to potential threats.
- **`multi_region_failover.py`**: This script manages the automated multi-region failover process. It continuously monitors the health of services in both the primary and secondary regions and orchestrates the rerouting of traffic in the event of a detected outage.

### Monitoring and Visualization

- **`web_dashboard.py`**: A Flask-based web application that serves the real-time monitoring dashboard. It utilizes Socket.IO to stream live data to the front end, ensuring a dynamic and up-to-date user experience.
- **`dashboard.html`**: The HTML template for the web dashboard, which defines the structure and layout of the user interface for visualizing the monitoring data.
- **`enhanced_dns_monitor.py`**: A terminal-based script that provides detailed DNS health check capabilities with a rich, color-coded output for easy analysis.
- **`simple_dns_monitor.py`**: A lightweight, terminal-based script for performing basic DNS health checks and publishing the results as metrics to Amazon CloudWatch.

### Deployment and Configuration

- **`deployment_script.py`**: This script automates the end-to-end deployment of the system, including the provisioning of IAM roles, Lambda functions, EventBridge rules, and CloudWatch dashboards.
- **`resilience_architecture.yaml`**: The AWS CloudFormation template that defines the core infrastructure, including the multi-region VPC setup, Application Load Balancer, ECS cluster, and the CloudWatch dashboard.

## Getting Started

A failover can be manually triggered by invoking the `perform_failover` method within the `multi_region_failover.py` script. This allows you to test the system's response to a controlled, simulated outage.

```python
from multi_region_failover import MultiRegionFailoverManager

# Initialize the manager
manager = MultiRegionFailoverManager()

# Trigger a manual failover
manager.perform_failover('us-east-1', 'us-west-2', 'Manual failover test')
```
